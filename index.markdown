## Create a Community of Petroleum and Mining modeling that Lasts

We want to build a community of people interested in creating open models of oil, gas and mining projects. For many reasons: it can take transparency to the next level, and show governments and peoples how much money they might earn, and what kind of deals they have with the companies, and how sensitive they are to various changes in price and market conditions. It can guide further advocacy for information which can tighten models based only on public information and based on wide margins of error. Models can be used to spread genuine awareness of how extractive industries work, and dispel myths and simplifications, and allow a genuinely independent, technically informed perspective on the claims of various interested parties. And... it's fun!


We are OpenOil, an opn data publisher based in Berlin working on transparency around extractives since 2011...
